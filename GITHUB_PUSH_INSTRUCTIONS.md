## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub**

1. **Go to GitHub:**
   - Open: https://github.com/new
   - Or click the `+` icon → "New repository"

2. **Fill in details:**
   - **Owner:** turaab97
   - **Repository name:** `defi-security-framework`
   - **Description:** `Multi-Chain DeFi Security Framework with Machine Learning and Live Blockchain Data`
   - **Visibility:** ✅ **Public** (so group members can access)
   - **Initialize:** ❌ **DO NOT** check "Add a README" (we already have one)
   - **License:** ❌ **DO NOT** add license (we already have one)
   - **.gitignore:** ❌ **DO NOT** add gitignore (we already have one)

3. **Click:** "Create repository"

### **Step 2: Push Your Code**

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. **Use these instead:**

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/defi-security-framework

# Link to your GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/turaab97/defi-security-framework.git

# Ensure you're on main branch
git branch -M main

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

**Enter your GitHub credentials when prompted:**
- Username: `turaab97`
- Password: Use a **Personal Access Token** (see below if needed)

---

### **Step 3: Add Collaborators (Group Members)**

1. **Go to Settings:**
   - https://github.com/turaab97/defi-security-framework/settings/access

2. **Click "Add people"**

3. **Enter GitHub usernames** of your group members

4. **Select access level:**
   - **Write** - Can push to repository
   - **Maintain** - Can manage issues and PRs
   - **Admin** - Full control (careful with this!)

5. **Click "Add [username] to this repository"**

6. **They will receive an email invitation**

---

### **Step 4: Share with Your Team**

Send your group members:

**Repository URL:**
```
https://github.com/turaab97/defi-security-framework
```

**Clone command:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/turaab97/defi-security-framework.git
cd defi-security-framework
```

cd defi-security-framework
```

**2. Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Create Their Branch:**
```bash
# Use their name
git checkout -b john/feature-name
# Example: git checkout -b sarah/add-bigquery
```

**4. Make Changes:**
- Edit files
- Add new features
- Fix bugs

**5. Commit Changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: description of changes"
```

## 🔑 Creating GitHub Personal Access Token (if needed)

If GitHub asks for a password and rejects it, you need a Personal Access Token:

1. **Go to:**
   - https://github.com/settings/tokens

2. **Click:** "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"

3. **Fill in:**
   - **Note:** "DeFi Framework Push Access"
   - **Expiration:** 90 days (or custom)
   - **Scopes:** ✅ Check `repo` (full control of private repositories)

4. **Click:** "Generate token"

5. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

6. **Use it as password** when git asks for credentials

## 📊 Repository Structure on GitHub

After pushing, your GitHub will have:

```
defi-security-framework/
├── README.md                    # Main documentation (shows on GitHub)
├── LICENSE                      # MIT License
├── CONTRIBUTING.md              # How to contribute
├── requirements.txt             # Python dependencies
├── .gitignore                   # Files to ignore
├── defi_web_app.py             # Web app (demo)
├── defi_web_app_live.py        # Web app (live data)
├── defi_demo_fast.py           # CLI version
├── simple_demo.py              # Simple version
├── standalone_demo.py          # Advanced version

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

### **Branch Strategy:**

- **`main`** - Production-ready code (protected)
- **`feature/xyz`** - New features
- **`bugfix/xyz`** - Bug fixes
- **`docs/xyz`** - Documentation updates

### **Workflow:**

1. **Group member clones repo**
2. **Creates feature branch**
3. **Works on their part**
4. **Pushes their branch**
5. **Creates Pull Request**
6. **You review and merge** to main

---

## 🔒 Protecting Main Branch (Recommended)

After pushing, protect your main branch:

1. **Go to:**
   - https://github.com/turaab97/defi-security-framework/settings/branches

2. **Click:** "Add rule"

3. **Branch name pattern:** `main`

4. **Enable:**
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass
   - ✅ Include administrators

5. **Save changes**

This prevents direct pushes to main - everyone must use Pull Requests!

---

## 📝 Quick Commands Reference

### **For You (Owner):**

```bash
# Check status
git status

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# View all branches
git branch -a

# Merge a PR locally
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### **For Group Members:**

```bash
# Get latest code
git pull origin main

# Create new branch
git checkout -b name/feature

# Switch branches
git checkout branch-name

# See what changed
git diff

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "message"

# Push branch
git push origin branch-name
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Error: "Permission denied"**
→ Make sure you've added collaborators
→ Check they accepted the invitation

### **Error: "Authentication failed"**
→ Use Personal Access Token instead of password
→ See "Creating GitHub Personal Access Token" above

### **Error: "fatal: remote origin already exists"**
→ Run: `git remote rm origin`
→ Then add again: `git remote add origin https://...`

### **Merge Conflicts**
→ Pull latest: `git pull origin main`
→ Fix conflicts in files
→ Commit: `git add . && git commit -m "Fix conflicts"`
→ Push: `git push origin your-branch`

## ✨ Tips for Collaboration

1. **Pull often** - Get latest changes frequently
2. **Commit often** - Small, focused commits
3. **Clear messages** - Descriptive commit messages
4. **Test first** - Test before pushing
5. **Review PRs** - Check code before merging
6. **Communicate** - Use GitHub Issues/Discussions
